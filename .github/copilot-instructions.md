# Copilot Instructions

- Organize each problem in its own folder, named as `###-problem-name` (e.g., `001-two-sum`).
- Place all solution files (e.g., `solution.py`, `solution.js`, `solution.ts`), `README.md`, and a `meta.json` file inside the problem folder.
- The `meta.json` should include: id, title, slug, difficulty, topics, sources, status, lastReviewed, and reviewNotes.
- Add review comments at the top of each solution file (problem link, approach, complexity, review notes).
- Update the README and PROBLEMS.md index as you add new problems.
- Use tags (topics, sources) in meta.json to group and filter exercises.
- No test files are included by default.
- Documentation and metadata should be kept up to date.
