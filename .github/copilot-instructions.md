# Copilot Instructions

- Organize each problem in its own folder, named as `###-problem-name` (e.g., `001-two-sum`).
- Place all solution files (e.g., `solution.py`, `solution.js`, `solution.ts`) and the README inside the problem folder.
- Update the README with new problems as you add them.
- No test files are included by default.
- Documentation should be kept up to date.
