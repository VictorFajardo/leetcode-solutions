# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to LeetCode problems in multiple languages.

## Structure
Each problem is organized in its own folder, named as `###-problem-name` (e.g., `001-two-sum`).

Inside each problem folder, you may find:
- `solution.py` — Python solution
- `solution.js` — JavaScript solution
- `solution.ts` — TypeScript solution
- `README.md` — Problem description and notes

## How to Use
- Add a new folder for each problem you solve.
- Place all language solutions and documentation for that problem in the same folder.
